## What is Decodo?
[Decodo](https://decodo.com/) is a rotating residential proxy network that allows users to collect data from the web using a pool of over 115 million IPs. It's based on real household devices, which ensures integrity and complete anonymity during online activities.

You can choose between rotating proxies, which change with each new request, or sticky IP sessions, which keep your session for a longer period (up to 30 minutes).

Looking for datacenter proxies instead? [Decodo offers a blazing-fast shared proxy pool](https://decodo.com/proxies/shared-proxies?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=repository&utm_content=hyperlink)! If you don't like sharing your IP address with someone else, you should also consider getting dedicated data center proxies. These proxies don't rotate and are yours exclusively with unlimited traffic. We also offer highly authentic mobile proxies and fast yet reliable static residential (ISP) proxies.

## How does it work?

Getting started with Decodo is simple. In the [dashboard](https://dashboard.decodo.com/residential-proxies/proxy-setup), select a session type: rotating or sticky, and whether you want IPs from a random location or a specific country/city. The system will generate relevant endpoints in endpoint:port format to use in your code or an application.

There are 2 authentication options: username:password and whitelisted IP. The username:password method requires you to use your unique credentials to access the proxy pool. Whitelisted IP allows you to add your IP address to the system to use our proxies without the need to authenticate. For more information, check out the [quick start guide](https://Decodo.com/Decodo-quick-start-guide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=repository&utm_content=hyperlink).

## Types
### Residential
Residential proxies use real devices based in physical locations worldwide. They act as intermediaries between you and your target and make your scripts look like they're coming from genuine users using regular everyday devices. You can avoid detection, bypass IP blocks or rate limitations, and freely access any website.

### Mobile
A mobile proxy is an intermediary from real mobile devices connected to any mobile carrier and run on mobile networks. They feature the highest success rates in overcoming CAPTCHAs or IP blocks, and advanced targeting options. Choose from IPs associated with 700+ ASNs, including Verizon, T-Mobile, O2, EE, and more.

## Locations
Decodo offers a wide proxy pool that covers 195+ locations worldwide. You can choose IPs from 195+ countries including the UK, US, Germany, India, Canada, Japan, and many more. [Check out the full list here](https://decodo.com/proxies/list).
