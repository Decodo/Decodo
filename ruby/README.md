## Disclaimer
If you want to continue development with Ruby, we highly recommend reading their [documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/).

## Prerequisites
To run the following code example, you'll need to have Ruby installed:
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

## Installation

Once you have Ruby installed, continue with the following steps:

1. Open the Command Prompt/Terminal.
1. Create your project directory using the `mkdir ruby_example` command.
2. Navigate to your project folder using the `cd ruby_example` command.
3. Execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decodo/Decodo/master/ruby/ruby.rb > ruby.rb`

4. You should see a new file named `ruby.rb` in your project folder. Open it using an editor of your choice.

5. To run this example, set your username, password, and endpoint information you'd like to use and enter them in the following sections of the code:
```
proxy_host = 'gate.decodo.com'
proxy_port = 7000
proxy_user = 'username'
proxy_pass = 'password'
```
## Usage

To execute the Ruby example, simply run `ruby ruby.rb` in your Terminal tool.
You should see the IP details from the target website in the console window if everything was set up correctly:
